Welcome to the Anonymous Phrases collection. This section contains verses and phrases from the Holy Quran that have profoundly impacted me during my journey of studying the divine text—verses so powerful and moving that I could not bring myself to ignore them, yet they don't fit neatly into other thematic categories.

These are the ayahs that stopped me in my tracks, that made me pause and reflect, that touched my heart in ways I cannot fully articulate. Each phrase here represents a moment of spiritual connection, a glimpse of divine wisdom that resonated deeply within my soul.

The "anonymous" designation reflects their diverse nature—some speak of faith and guidance, others of reflection and mercy, and some offer profound truths that defy simple categorization. What unites them is their power to move the heart and awaken the soul.

These phrases are presented in their original Arabic alongside translations in English, Urdu, and Hindi, with precise Quranic references so you can explore their full context. Click on any reference badge to open the complete verse on Quran.com with all three translations.

May these verses that touched my heart also touch yours, and may they serve as a source of guidance, comfort, and inspiration on your own spiritual journey.

  names: `
Welcome to the 99 Names collection. This section is dedicated to Quranic phrases that contain the beautiful Names of Allah—expressions that follow the pattern "And Allah is ___" or "Indeed Allah is ___".

These phrases are particularly special because they serve a dual purpose in our spiritual practice. They tell us who Allah is by mentioning His divine attributes and Names, and at the same time, they can be recited directly in our prayers to praise Allah before making du'a (supplication).

When we stand before Allah to ask for His mercy, guidance, or blessings, these phrases help us begin with praise and acknowledgment of His greatness—following the beautiful tradition that Allah hears those who praise Him. By using Allah's own words about Himself from the Quran, we glorify Him in the most authentic and beloved way.

The pattern "And Allah is..." or "Indeed Allah is..." makes these phrases ready to use in our prayers. We can say them exactly as they appear, preparing our hearts and minds to humbly present our needs before the All-Knowing, All-Merciful Creator.

Each phrase is presented in Arabic with translations in English, Urdu, and Hindi. Click any reference badge to view the complete verse on Quran.com with all three translations.

May these blessed Names and attributes help you know Allah better and beautify your prayers with His most beloved words.

  praises: `
Welcome to the Praises collection. This section is dedicated to verses and phrases that tell us who Allah is—beautiful expressions that describe His attributes, His names, and His magnificence.

What started as a personal quest to collect all 99 Names of Allah from the Quran evolved into something more comprehensive. I began including other profound phrases that follow the pattern "Allah is ___" or describe His divine attributes in ways that deepen our understanding of the Creator.

These phrases serve a special purpose in our spiritual practice. Before we make du'a (supplication) to Allah, we can recite these praises to glorify Him and acknowledge His greatness—following the beautiful tradition of "Sami Allahu liman hamidah" (Allah hears those who praise Him). By praising Allah with His own words about Himself, we prepare our hearts to humbly ask for His mercy and blessings.

Each phrase is presented in Arabic with translations in English, Urdu, and Hindi. The Quranic references are clickable—simply click any reference badge to view the complete verse on Quran.com with all three translations displayed.

Whether you're memorizing Allah's attributes, seeking phrases to beautify your prayers, or simply deepening your knowledge of who Allah is, this collection offers authentic expressions directly from the divine revelation.

  info: `
Welcome to the Info collection. This section contains additional profound revelations about Allah's attributes and nature—verses where Allah describes Himself, sometimes in the first person ("I am...") or third person, or where He addresses others directly about His divine qualities.

Unlike the 99 Names and Praises collections, these phrases cannot be recited word-for-word in our personal prayers because of their grammatical structure. For example, if Allah says "I am the Most Merciful," we cannot say "I am the Most Merciful" in our du'a—that would be inappropriate and a serious error.

However, these verses remain incredibly valuable for:
- Understanding Allah's attributes and how He describes Himself
- Learning about Allah's divine nature and magnificence  
- Deepening our knowledge of what Allah has revealed about Himself
- Gaining insight into how Allah addresses humanity

This collection includes verses where Allah speaks about Himself in different contexts—sometimes describing His power and knowledge, sometimes His mercy and forgiveness, and sometimes warning about His justice and might. Each verse adds another dimension to our understanding of the Creator.

Each phrase includes Arabic text with English, Urdu, and Hindi translations. Click any reference badge to open the full verse on Quran.com with all translations.

Note: There may be other verses in the Quran that describe Allah which I haven't included yet—this collection represents my ongoing journey through the divine text.

  prayers: `
Welcome to the Prayers collection. This section contains beautiful supplications (du'as) revealed in the Quran—divine guidance on how we should pray to Allah and what we should ask for.

Some of these prayers were made by prophets and righteous people in moments of need, difficulty, or gratitude, and Allah preserved them in the Quran as examples for us. When I encounter such prayers, I extract the exact phrase or supplication so that I too can pray to Allah using these blessed words.

Other prayers in this collection were revealed directly by Allah, teaching us what to ask for and how to express our needs and hopes. These divine instructions show us the most beautiful and effective ways to communicate with our Creator.

By collecting these Quranic prayers, I've created a treasure of authentic supplications that we can use in our own prayers—whether we're seeking guidance, forgiveness, protection, provision, or any other need. These are the very words that Allah has taught us or approved of, making them the most perfect prayers we could offer.

Each prayer is presented in Arabic with translations in English, Urdu, and Hindi, along with Quranic references. Click any reference to view the complete context on Quran.com.

May these blessed prayers bring you closer to Allah and help you express your deepest hopes and needs in the most beautiful way.
